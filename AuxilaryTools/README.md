The script Calculate_pixels_reached_steadystate.py can be used to assess
the degree of equilibration of state variables on the level of tiles in ORCHIDEE simulations (e.g. pre-run, site-run, and rer-run simulations).

This is done be fitting a linear trend on the total land C  at tile level over the whole period specified by user.
For ORCHIDEE CNP v1.3, we recommend to select a period of 100 years.

The statistics are reported on PFT level.
