- Converted dataset format to xarray
- Modified input features (added std of some variables like Qair, Psurf, etc.)
- Increase Nc values (by a factor of 2)
- Instead of averaging over the whole time span, only take monthly averages and separate data per year to increase dataset size
- Added new ML algorithm options: XGBoost, RandomForest, MLP, Lasso, Stacking Ensemble
- Implemented multithread parallelization to train a ML model per target variable in parallelization
